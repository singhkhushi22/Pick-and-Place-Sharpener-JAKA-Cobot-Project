ðŸ“„ Pick and Place Sharpener â€“ JAKA Cobot Project

## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates an **industrial pick-and-place application** using a **JAKA collaborative robot** equipped with a **pneumatic gripper**. The cobot is programmed to pick up a **sharpener** from a fixed position and place it at a designated location.

The motion is achieved using **linear movement commands** (`MoveL`) to ensure smooth and precise path control between waypoints.

## **Hardware Used**

* **JAKA Collaborative Robot** (6-axis)
* **Pneumatic Gripper** (for grasping the sharpener)
* **Air Compressor & Pneumatic Circuit**
* **Sharpener** (target object)
* **Work Table & Fixtures**

---

## **Software & Programming**

* **JAKA Programming Environment** (JAKA App / JAKA SDK)
* Programming Commands:

  * **MoveJ** (Joint Movement â€“ used for approach and safe positioning)
  * **MoveL** (Linear Movement â€“ used for pick and place path)

---

## **Working Principle**

1. **Initialization & Home Position** â€“ The cobot moves to a safe "home" position.
2. **Approach Position** â€“ The cobot uses **MoveJ** to reach the pre-pick waypoint.
3. **Pick Action** â€“

   * The cobot moves **linearly (MoveL)** down to the sharpener location.
   * The pneumatic gripper closes to grasp the sharpener.
4. **Transfer Path** â€“ The cobot moves **linearly** to the placement location.
5. **Place Action** â€“

   * The cobot opens the pneumatic gripper to release the sharpener.
   * Retracts back to the home or standby position.

## **Motion Commands in Use**

### **MoveJ (Joint Movement)**

* Moves each joint to the target position using the shortest possible path.
* Best for **approach, retract, and non-critical path moves**.
* Faster but not always a straight-line path.

### **MoveL (Linear Movement)**

* Moves the **TCP (Tool Center Point)** along a **straight line** in Cartesian space.
* Ideal for **pick-and-place paths where orientation and straight-line accuracy are critical**.

---

## **Pneumatic Gripper Control**

* **Open Command** â€“ Releases the sharpener.
* **Close Command** â€“ Grasps the sharpener.
* Actuated via **digital I/O signals** from the cobotâ€™s control panel.

---

## **Safety Considerations**

* Safe approach height before moving down to pick.
* Use of waypoints to avoid collisions.
* Pneumatic pressure adjusted to prevent object damage.

---

## **Applications**

* Stationary object handling
* Assembly line feeding
* Educational robotics demonstration
